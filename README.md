# Congress_Israel_Bills
This project tracks and analyzes Congressional votes on Israel-related bills by implementing a point-based scoring system. Each bill is assigned a “Pro-Israel” score based on its content and stance regarding Israel. Congress members are then evaluated based on their voting record, with each vote receiving a weighted score corresponding to the bill’s Pro-Israel score.

The result is a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of each Congress member’s support for Israel-related legislation, offering an insightful look into voting trends and positions.
